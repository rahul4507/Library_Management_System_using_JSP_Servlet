# Library Management System

The Library Management System is a web-based application that allows administrators to register themselves and perform various operations such as adding, deleting, updating, and reading information about books. 
The system utilizes technologies such as Apache Tomcat for the server, Servlet for handling server-side requests, JSP for dynamic web pages, JDBC for database connectivity, and MySQL as the backend database.
Additionally, Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS are used for user interface design.
